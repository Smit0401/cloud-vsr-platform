# Cloud-Driven Visual Speech Recognition Platform

A deep learning based system that converts lip movements in video into text using a cloud-hosted inference engine.

## 🧠 Problem
Traditional speech recognition fails in noisy environments. Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) enables speech understanding using only lip movements.

## 💡 Solution
This system uses computer vision and deep learning to extract visual features from lip movements and predict spoken text, deployed through a cloud-based API.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- CNN + LSTM
- FastAPI
- MongoDB
- React

## 🚀 Features
- Upload video
- Lip region detection
- Deep learning based speech decoding
- Cloud inference
- Text output

Project is under active development.
